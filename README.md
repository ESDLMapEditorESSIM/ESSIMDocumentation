## Online documentation

This documentation is hosted at: https://essimdocumentation.readthedocs.io/

To generate the documentation:

``` shell
cd docs

```

Then the html is generated in the directory ```docs\build\html```. Open the ```index.html``` in that directory in
your browser to see your changes.
