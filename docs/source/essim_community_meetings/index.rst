First ESSIM Community Meeting (14th of October 2021)
----------------------------------------------------
On October 14th 2021, the first ESSIM community meeting was organized. ESSIM users from different organisations were invited to the event with a focus to discuss the current possibilities, for a look under the hood and to have a sneak peek of what new features and applications lay in the road ahead for the tool. Beforehand, a list of possible topics was sent to the ESSIM users and they were requested to indicate what topic(s) they preferred to have included in the agenda. The preferences of the users were so diverse although one topic (modelling energy flexibility) unanimously stood out from the rest. This made our agenda a lot clearer - we chose to spend one slide on every topic and a few slides on the possibilities of modelling energy flexibility.

To create a similar level of knowledge for all participants and to better understand the explanation of the 'selected topics', we started with presenting the "ESSIM working principles": the topics of control strategies, energy balancing, bid curves and marginal costs and transport solvers were explained.

Then we continued with the selected topics:

- Using real energy market prices in ESSIM simulations
- Support for multi-input multi-output assets
- ESSIM KPI modules
- CO2 calculations
- Using the ESSIM API
- ESSIM combined with loadflow simulations
- Connecting external asset models to ESSIM

This was followed up by a more in depth explanation of the current possibilities of modelling flexibility and the ongoing projects covering this specific topic. This triggered some relevant and interesting questions from the audience, which spurred the subsequent discussion session. With some time to spare, we also took the opportunity to showcase some non ESSIM-related work we're doing with respect to the spatial aspect of the energy transition (including spatial optimization).

The following ESSIM users were invited and most of them were present (in alphabetical order):

- Ecorys
- Ekwadraat (not present)
- EQUANS (formerly known as ENGIE)
- MUG Engineering
- Saxion University of Applied Sciences
- Shell (not present)
- Siemens
- Stedin

The reactions from the users were very positive. They found it a very informative meeting and were impressed by the flexibility and possibilities of the ESSIM tool. We agreed to organize a next community meeting in about half a year (March or April 2022).
