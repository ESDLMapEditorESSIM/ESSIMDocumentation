First ESSIM Community Meeting (14th of October 2021)
----------------------------------------------------
On october 14th 2021 the first ESSIM community meeting was organized. Beforehand a list of possible topics was sent to
the known ESSIM users and they were requested to indicate what topic(s) they preferred to have included in the agenda.
The preferences of the users were so diverse and only only topic (modelling energy flexibility) stood out, we chose
to spend one slide on every topic and a few slides on the possibilities of modelling energy flexibility.

To create a similar level of knowledge for all participants and to better understand the explanation of the 'selected
topics', we started with presenting the "ESSIM working principles": the topics of control strategies, energy balancing,
bid curves and marginal costs and transport solvers were explained.

Then we continued with the selected topics:

* Using real energy market prices in ESSIM simulations
* Support for multi-input multi-output assets
* ESSIM KPI modules
* CO2 calculations
* Using the ESSIM API
* ESSIM combined with loadflow simulations
* Connecting external asset models to ESSIM

This was followed up by a more in depth explanation of the current possibilities of modelling flexibility and the
ongoing projects covering this specific topic. After some questions and discussions, we also showed some non ESSIM
related work we're doing with respect to spatial aspect of the energy transition (including spatial optimization).

The following ESSIM users were invited and most of them were present (in alphabetical order):

* Ecorys
* Ekwadraat (not present)
* ENGIE
* EQUANS (formerly known as ENGIE Services NL)
* MUG Engineering
* Saxion University of Applied Sciences
* Shell (not present)
* Siemens
* Stedin

The reactions from these users were very positive. They found it a very informative meeting and were impressed by the
flexibility and possibilities of the ESSIM tool. We agreed to organize a next community meeting in about half a year
(March or April 2022).
